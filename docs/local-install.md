# Local Install

> If you would prefer to run things locally, you can do that as well.

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Since we are using Python 3.9, you may need to specify the version of python when creating the virtual environment:

```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
```

To exit the Python Virtual Environment, type the following into terminal:

```bash
deactivate
```

Windows WSL:
---

> You will likely need to run this command before you can run the install process ( replace `3.9` in `python3.9-venv` with your machines version of python )

```bash
sudo apt install python3.9-venv
```
